### Authors: Pradeep Muthaiya, Sean Shimohara, Thi Ngyuen, and Wesley Cheung 

Project Description: This project is our final homework assignment for the Stat 159 Course taught at UC Berkeley. For this assignment, we analyze the publicly available Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease Dataset. Here is a description of the files in the repo:
- `data` is a folder that contains the .csv file of the dataset used in our analysis
- `figures` is a folder that contains all of the .png files we generated from our analysis
- `tools` is a folder that contains the custom functions we used in our analysis, along with some simple tests for these functions
- `contribution_statement.md` is a Markdown file outlining each group member's contributions to this repo
- `EDA.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook displaying the exploratory data analysis we ran on the dataset
- `environment.yml` is a .yml file that can be used to reproduce the environment we ran our analysis on
- `hw07-description.md` is a Markdown file containing the instructions for this homework assignment
- `LICENSE` is a license for our work
- `main.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that contains a detailed description of our analysis and findings
- `Makefile` is a Makefile that allows the easy rerunning of our analysis
- `model.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that displays the process by which we created our classifiers from the dataset
- `pyproj.toml` is used to install our custom package
- `setup.cfg` is used to install our custom package
- `setup.py` is used to install our custom package
- `_config.yml` is used to produce the jupyter book
- `_toc.yml` is used to produce the jupyter book
